# AudioSteganography-RSA-ChaCha20
A project which performs LSB based Audio Steganography to hide secret data in the form of text, image, etc into a cover audio file. It also encrypts the secret data using the RSA and ChaCha20 Algorithm.

This project introduces a multilevel approach to the existing LSB encoding technique to enhance the security of the embedded data in the audio file using RSA and ChaCha20 encryption techniques.
